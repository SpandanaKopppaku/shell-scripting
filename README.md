### How to authenticate from your local to GitHub ?
1) Github authentication works based on PAT. ( Personal Acccess Token )
2) your profile on github ---> settings ---> Developer Settings  ----> Generate Classic PAT 
3) When you do a git push, git prompts you to enter the PAT and that's it. You're authenticated.

PS : PAT is sensitive and is not supposed to be shared with anyone.
